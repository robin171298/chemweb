  <ul>
    <li>Name and PubChem CID – for clear identification</li>
    <li>Molecular formula and molecular weight – basic chemical properties</li>
    <li>XLogP and polar surface area – indicators of lipophilicity and brain penetration</li>
    <li>Hydrogen bond donors and acceptors – important for drug-likeness</li>
    <li>Mechanism of action – how the drug works biologically</li>
    <li>Main medical use – what the drug is used for in medicine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These properties are commonly used in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology to describe and compare drugs.</p>
